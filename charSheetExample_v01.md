Backstory
Eamon was born and raised in a secluded Firbolg community deep in the forest. A devastating forest fire caused by human activity destroyed his home, forcing him and the other survivors to leave. He's since been traveling, using his skills to help others and teach them about the importance of living in harmony with nature. He's taken up dungeon delving to protect the natural world from the threats that lurk beneath the earth. He has a younger sister, Faela, who also survived the fire. She's a hunter and a skilled archer. Eamon has a strong bond with her, and he often thinks back to the days when he taught her how to track animals and identify plants.
