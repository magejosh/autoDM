Starting Premise: the unknown artist magejosh sighed as his truck broke down, and he began walking the country road to his home. That's the day the giant aliens arrived and filled the sky, said they were invading, and magejosh thought to himself, "of course there's aliens invading today" before the hair on the back of his neck stood up. The air began to smell strange and lightning began filling the sky. the two closest giant aliens struck by a massive lightning bolt that raced through them like they were nothing on it's way to the lonely human walking on the road below. "Uh oh" was all he had time to think as he processed that image. And yet somehow he survives this, gaining superpowers that help him empower others to save the earth.
