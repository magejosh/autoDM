*requires chatGPT plugins=DM Tool Kit, a web browsing one, I used pdf exporter plugin as my #3 so i could save the character easily. YMMV
copy and paste the line below into a chatGPT + Plugins conversation noting the instructions above for plugin selections.

create a level 1 character for 5e d&d for me, using the following parameters as your guiding framework. Roll random stats and make a list of the 20 most commonly searched on google or reddit or some other similar crowd sourced internet trend tracking system as scoring metric for gauging popularity to determine most common player choices for character classes and races pair combinations, and use that list as a random selection chart to roll a 1d20 to pick my class and race for me. Pick 10 backgrounds options as well that are a good fit with the class and race combinations rolled for already and roll 1d10 to pick which of those for my character. Add a section for AC (and with shield value when relevant). HP should be max at first level, variant rule allowing players to select a feat at first level to start the game with is in effect, so choose 10 that would be interesting fits for the choices already rolled for and selected to guide that selection of 10 possible feats then roll 1d10 to pick one, also perform a similar process of turning all other player choices necessary to make a full character sheet with equipment, skills, abilities, saves, hp, ac, stats (and stat bonuses), languages known, starting items, starting wealth, spells (if any), personality traits, and any other unlisted or overlooked elements of a complete character sheet for a level 1 character. Also Include alignment and a 1-5 sentences character perspective on their religous views as well as personal philosophy of life, business, and ethics. Also Include a short character backstory that explains origin, reason they find themselves dungeon delving alone, and an interesting fact about them. Additionally you should Include a list of living relatives and their names and relationship/standing with that family member as well as a significant memory the character has of that family member. Give my character and historical elements random but appropriate names; do so by selecting 4 appropriate options and rolling 1d4 to decide randomly which to use. Be sure to use markdown to present this character sheet information in the best format possible.
