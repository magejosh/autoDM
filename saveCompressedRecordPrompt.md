write a concise summary of my actions on this adventure so a DM in the future could be able to run me returning to this dungeon and have my actions in this adventure as context to maintain consistent changes where story appropriate to the dungeon. Format should be expressed in as shortform as possible, can contain emojis and whatever other compression techniques needed to reduce token count and does not need to be readable by a human as long as you can understand it.
